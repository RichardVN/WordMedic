# WordMedic
A spell checking web application. 
- Confirms if a word is spelled correctly.
- If a word is incorrectly spelled: suggests words that are close to the mispelled word (using Levenshtein distance). 
- The user may customize how many suggested words to see

This is an extension of my previous spellchecking project found at https://github.com/RichardVN/spellchecker, which consisted of C and Python implementations of spellcheck using a command line interface.
